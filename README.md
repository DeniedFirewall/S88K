S88K - Wi-Fi Pentesting Library
S88K is a Wi-Fi pentesting library built entirely from scratch using Python. It allows you to scan networks, perform deauthentication attacks, capture WPA handshakes, and crack WPA passwords without relying on any external pentesting libraries.


Features
Wi-Fi Scanning: Discover available Wi-Fi networks and their details (SSID, BSSID, signal strength).
Deauthentication Attack: Perform a deauthentication attack to disconnect a target device from the network.
WPA Handshake Capture: Capture WPA handshakes for further analysis.
WPA Cracking: Brute-force attack on WPA passwords using a wordlist and captured WPA handshakes.
No external dependencies: Built entirely using Python's built-in libraries and raw sockets.


Disclaimer
S88K is intended for educational purposes and authorized pentesting only.
Do not use it to attack networks without permission. Unauthorized access to computer networks is illegal.
